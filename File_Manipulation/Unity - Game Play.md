## Unity - Game Play

Unity is a game development platform used to build high-quality 3D-2D games that can deployed across mobile, desktop, VR/AR, consoles, or the web.

### Properties
|Property|	    |
|----------|-------------|
|  angularDrags:  | Coefficient of angular drag..|
| angularVelocity:  | Angular velocity in degrees per second.|	     
|  bodyType:  |	The physical behaviour type of the Rigidbody2D..|	        
|  interpolation:   |Physics interpolation used between updates..|	  


### Colliders :-Collider interactions
Colliders interact with each other differently depending on how their Rigidbody components are configured. The three important configurations are the Static Collider (ie, no Rigidbody is attached at all), the Rigidbody Collider and the Kinematic Rigidbody Collider.

1. Static Collider
2. Rigidbody Collider
3. Kinematic Rigidbody Collider
