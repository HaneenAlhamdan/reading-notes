## Open-Source Software Contribution

OSS Contribution-Tracker is a tool that tracks external contributions to third-party open source software and CLAs that are sometimes associated.
Definition of Contributions Contributions are "more than just code" and are often times hard to measure. Our team tries to start with a small subset and update this section over time.
Source Code Documentation Tutorials and blog posts Workshops and trainings Issue discussion, resolving bugs and suggesting feature design/architecture Package and release distribution Help on community forums and social media Resource and Time Dedication Developer Evangelists are encouraged to find time every week for Open Source contributions.

### Improve Coding Skills
As with almost all professionals, the only way to truly learn and perfect your craft is to practice, practice, practice. However, few professions provide the means to practice on real projects. A mechanic, for example, can gain skills and experience by working on his own car or a friend’s, but won’t necessarily receive the valuable feedback from a seasoned mechanic needed to further develop his skills.

For developers, contributing to OSS means that they not only practice their programming skills, but that they also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers. This jumping-in-the-deep-end style of learning provides aspiring programmers with real-life, first-hand experience and greatly accelerates their learning curve.

### What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software
It can be hard to imagine that many of the applications and programs we use today are built by hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people all over the world. Open-source software (OSS) is a rapidly growing industry that provides many benefits to the individuals and businesses who use it, as well as to its programmers.

For many outside of the IT world, the concept of contributing to open-source software seems like a remarkable psychological phenomenon, as many of the contributors do it by their own free will and are quite often unpaid for it. The thought of contributing to something that requires a good amount of time without getting a dime for their work can be hard to fully understand.
