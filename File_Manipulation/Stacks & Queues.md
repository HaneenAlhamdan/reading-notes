## A Stack
 is a linear data structure. that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

 A Stack represents a last-in, first-out collection of objects. It is used when you need last-in, first-out access to items. It is both a generic and non-generic type of collection. The generic stack is defined in System.Collections.Generic namespace whereas non-generic stack is defined under System.Collections namespace, here we will discuss non-generic type stack. A stack is used to create a dynamic collection that grows, according to the need of your program. In a stack, you can store elements of the same type or different types.

## A Queue 
is a linear data structure. It is an ordered list that follows the principle FIFO (First In -First Out). A Queue is a structure that follows some restrictions on insertion and deletion

A Queue is used to represent a first-in, first out(FIFO) collection of objects. It is used when you need first-in, first-out access of items. It is the non-generic type of collection which is defined in System.Collections namespace. It is used to create a dynamic collection which grows, according to the need of your program. In Queue, you can store elements of the same type and of the different types. Generally, a queue is helpful when you access that information in the same way in which they stored in the collection and it is temporary storage to store data.
