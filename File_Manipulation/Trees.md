## Trees

The data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively. There are various types of data structures, such as stack, linked list, and queue, arranged in sequential order. For example, a linked data structure consists of a set of nodes that are linked together by links or points.  

Similarly, the tree data structure is a kind of hierarchal data arranged in a tree-like structure. It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub nodes, which are connected via edges. We can also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another.  

A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value, a list of references to nodes (the “children”).

## Basic Terminology In Tree Data Structure:

* Parent Node: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. {2} is the parent node of {6, 7}.
* Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. Examples: {6, 7} are the child nodes of {2}.
* Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node. {1} is the root node of the tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.
* Degree of a Node: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is called the degree of the node. The degree of a leaf node must be 0. The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the nodes in the tree. The degree of the node {3} is 3.
*Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. {6, 14, 8, 9, 15, 16, 4, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19} are the leaf nodes of the tree.
