## Payment Processing


Technical documentation can quickly go from “here’s how to use this if you’re unfamiliar and have limited experience” to “here’s an unedited transcript of everything our developer told us about this obscure application of our API.” One’s going to get you using the product right away, while the other will make you go cross-eyed.

Technical documentation isn’t just about capturing information. It’s about presenting it in a way that’s easy to read, usable, and actually helpful for your audience. So if you don’t know where to start, here’s our short guide to making technical documentation that’s actually helpful.

### How to plan, write, and deliver technical documentation that works
1. Do research and create a “Documentation Plan”
2. Structure and design
- Use templates or “schemas” for consistent on-page design
- Create a simple, logical navigation structure

3. Create the content
- Start with a draft
- Use the 30/90 rule to get feedback
- Get peer reviews and make revisions
- Edit, edit, and edit some more

4. Deliver and test
5. Create a maintenance and update schedule

The 4 additional qualities of great technical documentation
Technical documents can empower or frustrate—the choice is yours

### Here are a few examples of where and how you can use technical documentation:

End-user support: This means things like user guides, release notes, online help systems, training programs, or operating procedures—anything that helps users use your product.
Marketing support: Anything that’s product-focused and used to market your company (like explainer videos, presentations, or technical landing pages)
Development support: This could be functional and technical specifications, software development guides, or simply procedures and tools to help your developers do their jobs.
Organization support: Information about your company, structure, procedures, workflows, policies, and anything else teammates need to know to do their jobs.

###  How the process would work if you had an application such as online registration:

1. User enters credit card information into the application
2. Credit card information is sent to the Payment Gateway via a secure channel
3. The Payment Gateway routes the credit card to the appropriate Internet Merchant Account
4. Internet Merchant Account connects to the Merchant Account for credit card processing.
5. The result is passed back to the Gateway and then the application.
