## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
which we often refer to as Space and Time. In order to analyze these limiting factors, we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:
* Input Size
* Units of Measurement
* Orders of Growth
* Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

## Linked Lists
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.
The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly.

### Terminology:
- Linked List
- Singly
- Doubly
- Node
- Next
- Head
- Current  

### Types of Linked List:
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List

### complexity:
* time: O(n) (worse case) the node which has the value that searches for it is last

* space: O(1) This because there is no additional space being used

### what makes arrays and linked lists different?:
### Memory management
- arrays: are static data structures.
- linked lists: are dynamic data structures.
- The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines.
- When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory(all in one place ). On the other hand, when a linked list is born, it doesnâ€™t need bytes of memory all in one place. One byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in memory altogether!
