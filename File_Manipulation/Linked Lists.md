## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
which we often refer to as Space and Time. In order to analyze these limiting factors, we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:
* Input Size
* Units of Measurement
* Orders of Growth
* Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

## Linked Lists
Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the basis.

Basic concepts and nomenclature:-
- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Multiply linked list
- Circular linked list
- Sentinel nodes
