## JAM Stack

### What is Jamstack?
Jamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity.

The core principles of pre-rendering, and decoupling, enable sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before.

### Serverless
"Serverless" or "serverless functions" are a means of providing a run-time environment for code without the need for knowledge of, or control over, the underlying environment. It allows event-driven logic on the server without setting up infrastructure.

Common confusion over the term stems from the observation that "there is still a server somewhere", which is true, but no servers are present in the problem space of those working with serverless functions. In a similar way, a wireless router will have wires for power and connectivity, but no wires exist in the domain of the devices utilizing a wireless router to connect to the internet.

### Enhancing with JavaScript
With the markup and other user interface assets of Jamstack sites served directly from a CDN, they can be delivered very quickly and securely. On this foundation, Jamstack sites can use JavaScript and APIs to talk to backend services, allowing experiences to be enhanced and personalized.

Jamstack is a software architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and more scalable. It utilizes the following underlying components:

J – JavaScript
A – APIs
M – markup

### Examples
 of Jamstack projects range from a simple HTML webpage with potentially no JavaScript deployed to a web host to a full-scale blog built with Vue.js powered by a headless CMS like Ghost. The two are vastly different implementations, but they’re still built on the same principle.

 ### What makes a website Jamstack today?
A website can be considered Jamstack based on the markup and how it is served. If your application is not compiling and rendering an HTML file on a server at request time, then your website is Jamstack. Once again, you don’t have to use JavaScript or even call APIs for your website to be considered Jamstack.
